# Cognitive Planning Architecture Diagram

This file serves as a placeholder for the cognitive planning architecture diagram.
The actual diagram should illustrate:

- Natural language command input
- LLM processing and reasoning
- Task decomposition and planning
- Action plan validation
- Integration with vision and execution systems

The diagram should show the cognitive planning process from high-level command to executable action plan.
