# Action Execution Architecture Diagram

This file serves as a placeholder for the action execution architecture diagram.
The actual diagram should illustrate:

- Action plan input
- Task sequencing and dependencies
- Safety validation
- Robot control systems
- Execution monitoring
- Error handling and recovery

The diagram should show the flow from action plan to robot execution with safety and monitoring layers.
