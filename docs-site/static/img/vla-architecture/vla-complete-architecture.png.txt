# Complete VLA Architecture Diagram

This file serves as a placeholder for the complete VLA architecture diagram.
The actual diagram should illustrate:

- End-to-end VLA pipeline
- All major components and their relationships
- Data flow from voice input to action execution
- Service and message interfaces
- Safety and monitoring systems
- Integration points with Isaac Sim and ROS 2

The diagram should provide a comprehensive architectural overview of the entire VLA system.
