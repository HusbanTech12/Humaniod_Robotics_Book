# Capstone Architecture Diagram

This file serves as a placeholder for the capstone architecture diagram.
The actual diagram should illustrate:

- Complete VLA system integration
- Voice-Language-Action flow
- All component interconnections
- Data flow between modules
- External system integrations
- End-to-end pipeline visualization

The diagram should provide a comprehensive view of the entire VLA system architecture.
