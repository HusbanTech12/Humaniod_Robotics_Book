# Vision Grounding Architecture Diagram

This file serves as a placeholder for the vision grounding architecture diagram.
The actual diagram should illustrate:

- Camera sensor input
- Isaac ROS vision processing
- Object detection and localization
- 3D spatial reasoning
- Scene understanding
- Integration with planning and execution

The diagram should show the flow from visual input to spatially-grounded object information.
