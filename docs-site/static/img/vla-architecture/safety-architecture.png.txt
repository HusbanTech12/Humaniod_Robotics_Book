# Safety Architecture Diagram

This file serves as a placeholder for the safety architecture diagram.
The actual diagram should illustrate:

- Safety validation layers
- Pre-execution checks
- Real-time monitoring
- Emergency stop systems
- Constraint validation
- Risk assessment and mitigation

The diagram should show the safety architecture integrated throughout the VLA system.
