# Voice Processing Architecture Diagram

This file serves as a placeholder for the voice processing architecture diagram.
The actual diagram should illustrate:

- Voice input from microphone array
- OpenAI Whisper processing
- Natural language understanding
- LLM-based task decomposition
- Action plan generation
- Integration with other VLA components

The diagram should show the flow from voice command to structured action plan.
