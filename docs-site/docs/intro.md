# ROS 2 for Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the **ROS 2 for Humanoid Robotics** educational module. This comprehensive guide teaches students, researchers, and engineers how to apply AI to physical humanoid systems using ROS 2.

## About This Module

This module focuses on "The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)" - bridging the gap between digital intelligence and physical execution. You'll learn:

- ROS 2 architecture, nodes, topics, services, and actions
- How to connect Python AI agents to ROS 2 controllers using rclpy
- How to create, launch, and manage ROS 2 packages and parameter files
- How to design humanoid robot models using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- How to implement multi-node communication for robot systems

## Getting Started

To get started with this educational module, begin with the setup instructions and progress through the modules in order.

### What you'll need

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (recommended) or compatible Linux system
- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installed
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git installed

## Module Structure

This educational module is organized into several key sections:

1. **Getting Started** - Setup and basic concepts
2. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Core ROS 2 concepts for humanoid robotics
3. **Tutorials** - Hands-on examples and practical applications

Each section builds upon the previous, creating a comprehensive learning path for humanoid robotics development with ROS 2.
