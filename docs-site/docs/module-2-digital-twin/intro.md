# Introduction to Digital Twins for Humanoid Robotics

This module focuses on creating high-fidelity digital twins of humanoid robots and their environments for testing, validation, and human-robot interaction. We'll explore physics-accurate simulation, sensor emulation, and environment visualization using Gazebo and Unity.

## About This Module

This module covers "The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)" - creating virtual replicas of humanoid robots that accurately simulate their physical behavior. You'll learn:

- Gazebo physics simulation: gravity, collisions, and dynamic interactions
- Building and configuring humanoid digital twins in Gazebo using URDF/SDF models
- Simulating sensor data for LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs, and force/torque sensors
- Creating interactive Unity environments for visualization and human-robot interaction
- Integrating sensor data streams into ROS 2 topics for perception and control pipelines
- Validating simulation accuracy and correspondence with expected physical behaviors

## Getting Started

To get started with this module, ensure you have the prerequisites installed and work through the topics in order.

### What you'll need

- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill (installed from Module 1)
- Gazebo (included with ROS 2 desktop installation)
- Unity 2021+ (for Unity-specific examples)
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git installed
